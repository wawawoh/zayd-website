    <div class="who-i-am-content content"><h2>Meet Zayd</h2>
    <p>Hey my name is zayd ive been in the heath industry over the past 7 years, but my passion for health and wellbeing stems from what I believe all of us experience at some stage in our life as its part of our innate being in wanting to be our healthiest and fittest self, whether that’s through our nutrition, movement, mindset, sleep quality or our environment. <br><br>
My passion for this comes through you as I love helping people becoming their healthiest and fittest self and it’s the one thing we can all relate to. This is what made me want to get into personal training and pursue a degree and achieve a first class in  nutrition exercise and health and undertake cpd training in behaviour change in order  to deliver an optimisable, tailored evidence based  plan for yourself to build a sustainable long term version of you where you can look back and not feel guilty but rather pround and have autonomy over what you do. <br><br>
I myself am not perfect, but life isn’t perfect, so why should you feel the need to having everything figured out. You have taken the 1st step to success as your reading this. You know how the aaying goes its not the destination it’s the journey. And beginning this journey with me will help you become 1% better and help you reach your goal. <br><br>
So with all that said I hope to hear from you soon where we can build a plan together and see what works for you.
